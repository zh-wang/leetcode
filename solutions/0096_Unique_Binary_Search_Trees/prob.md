Given n, how many structurally unique BSTs (binary search trees)
that store values 1...n?

Example
Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's.

1           3    3       2      1
 \         /    /       / \      \
  3      2     1       1   3      2
 /      /       \                  \
2     1          2                  3
